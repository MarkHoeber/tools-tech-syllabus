DITA Introduction
###################

DITA stands for **Darwin Information Typing Architecture**.

* **Darwin** for the principles of specialization and inheritance. That is, users can evolve DITA for specific needs. (Not part of this class.)

* **Information typing** because each topic has a defined primary objective and structure.

* **Architecture** because DITA is an extensible set of structures.

Goals
*********

* Understand the philosophy and goals of DITA.

* Learn the basic DITA topic types: concept, task, reference.

* Understand the idea of structured authoring.

oXygen
*********

For working with DITA, we will use a program called :xref:`oXygen XML Editor`.

Download and install the trial version, which you can use for 30 days.

(You can also use GitHub on the web or Sublime locally to work directly in
DITA code. Note that you can't validate XML files when editing on GitHub.)

Assignment

|Assignment|

#. Fork the :xref:`Get Started with DITA` and create a new branch.

#. In GitHub, read the example concept, task, and reference examples and get
   familiar with the constructs and the code markup.

#. Pull the branch to your computer, then open the files with oXygen.

#. Replace the content in the files with content from your own projects.
   Think about what content is conceptual, task-based, and reference, and
   place accordingly.
