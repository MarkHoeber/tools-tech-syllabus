|Assignment|

Part 1
=========

#. Make a fork of |markhoeber.github.io| in your own GitHub account.

#. In *Settings*, change the name of your repository to ``your-github-username.github.io``.

#. View your website at ``http://your-github-username.github.io``.

   This is the website created by the repository you just forked.

   The page should look like the following image.

   .. image:: images/jekyll-site.png
     :width: 400

#. Read the repository ReadMe for instructions on setting up your computer to work with Jekyll.

#. Install Jekyll.

#. Clone the repository to your computer.

#. Create a new branch.

#. To serve the website created by Jekyy, at the command prompt, enter: ``jekyll serve``.

#. In your browser, go the the page ``http://localhost:4000/``.

   At this step, the site should look the same as at ``http://your-github-username.github.io``.

Part 2
=========

Look back to the class :ref:`Markdown`.

#. In your branch, edit the file ``about.md``.  Add information about yourself.

#. In the ``_posts`` directory, duplicate the existing post and give it a new name.

   .. note:: You must use the following format for the filename:  ``yyyy-mm-dd-name.md``.

#. Edit the new Markdown file to have whatever content you want. Use at least one image.

#. In the command prompt, stop the Jekyll server by entering ``ctr+c``.

#. Restart the Jekyll server by entering ``jekyll serve``.

#. View ``http://localhost:4000/`` and verify your changes.

#. Iterate through updating your post and restarting the server until you are satisfied with the results.
