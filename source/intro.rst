Introduction

Goals
*******

This course will help you become familiar with a wide variety of current tools and technologies writers use to publish online content.

This course will not make anyone an expert in any tool. Rather, we aim to:

* Help you learn basic skills in a variety of tools.

* Provide context for tool choices.

* And most importantly, help you *learn how to learn*. 

  Undoubtedly, in five years you will not be using the same tools and technology we use in this class. You will need to adapt to rapid change.  We will stress using all available sources, and hands-on use, to learn new tools.

At the end of the course, you should have:

* A broad understanding of multiple technologies.

* The ability to create basic content with different tools.

* The inclination to ask the right questions and find the answers when learning about new technical subject.

An "Flip" Classroom
********************

Traditional classes involve a teacher talking and demonstrating during class time, and students completing assignments outside of class.

This class "flips" that model. Students are expected to read and view all material for the class before coming to the classroom. We will use class time to:

* Ask and answer questions.

* Do hands on work, individually and in teams.

* Share work in an open, supportive atmosphere.

I do not intend to lecture during class. 

Expectations
*************

You must bring curiosity and enthusiasm for hands on work.

You must do the reading and watch videos before class, so we can use
class time for discussion and hands-on learning.

You are expected to collaborate, in small teams and as a class.  There will be team projects -- after all, that is how most of you will work.  I will comment on your work. You are encouraged to help each other and comment on each other's work as well.

You should be familiar and comfortable with either a Mac or Windows, and web browsing.

Setup
********

We will use GitHub in this class. To get started, create an GitHub account.

|GitHub - Join|

Then send an email to hoeber.m.c@gmail.com with your GitHub username. I will then add you as a collaborator for this project.

We will discuss GitHub in the 1st class.  Do the reading before then.

Class Discussions
******************

We will use the |GitHub - Issues| page of this syllabus for class discussion.

GitHub issues function much like a discussion board. You can start a new issue, and comment on existing issues. Issues are Open or Closed.  I'll close an issue when the question has been answered. But you can still get good information by browsing Closed issues.

Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, and comment on others questions.

To get started, please go to the GitHub - Issues page, find the Introductions issue, and add a comment to introduce yourself.

An Open Source Course
***********************

To align with industry trends, we will use several open source technologies in this class.  Writers should be aware of these options. The days of buying expensive software from large vendors, then being locked into that system, are over.

In addition, we're not just learning about the open source world, we are experiencing it.

How? Let's look at the ways:

* Much of the content of this course comes from freely available sources, such
  as Wikipedia, YouTube, and SlideShare. My
  role is to assemble sources into a coherent story that meets our
  objectives.

* Content on |WP| and YouTube, two of our primary sources, is created by users,
  not owners. That is, these platforms derive their value from the aggregated
  efforts of the community, just as do the open source projects we will discuss.

* This syllabus is created, stored, and hosted using only open source tools.
  This didn't cost a cent, and just about any aspect of it can be modified.

* In fact, **this syllabus is open source**, with a Creative Commons
  license. You can, and are encouraged to, make it
  better and to share it, using the tools we will learn about.
