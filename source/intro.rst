Introduction

Goals
*******

This course will help you become familiar with a wide variety of current tools
and technologies writers use to publish online content.

This course will not make anyone an expert in any tool. Rather, we aim to:

* Help you learn basic skills in a variety of tools.

* Provide context for tool choices.

* And most importantly, help you *learn how to learn*.

  Undoubtedly, in five years you will not be using the same tools that we use
  in this class. You will need to adapt to rapid change.  We will stress using
  all available sources, and hands-on use, to learn new tools.

At the end of the course, you should have:

* A broad understanding of multiple technologies.

* The ability to create basic content with different tools.

* The inclination to ask the right questions and find the answers when
  learning about a new technical subject.

A "Flip" Classroom
********************

Traditional classes involve a teacher talking and demonstrating during class
time, and students completing assignments outside of class.

This class "flips" that model. Students are expected to read and view all
material for the class, and work on assignments, before coming to the
classroom. We will use class time to:

* Ask and answer questions.

* Do hands on work, individually and in teams.

* Share work in an open, supportive atmosphere.

I do not intend to lecture during class.

GitHub
********

We will use GitHub to communicate and to exchange files. 

Many of you will use GitHub or a similar system in your future jobs, so this
is a good opportunity to learn more about it.To get started, create an GitHub
account.

:xref:`GitHub Join`

Then add your GitHub user name to the :xref:`GitHub Issues` discussion so the rest
of the class can collaborate with you.

We will discuss GitHub in the 1st class.  Do the reading before then.

Editors 
***********************

For most assignments, we will use Sublime to edit files.

We will discuss Sublime in the 1st class.  Do the reading before then.

Later in the semester we will install trial versions of FrameMaker and Madcap
Flare.

.. caution:: Do not install these programs until we are near those classes;
  otherwise, your trial period might end before you can complete the
  assignments.

Expectations
*************

You must bring curiosity and enthusiasm for hands on work.

You must do the reading and watch videos before class, so we can use class
time for discussion and hands-on learning. If you get stuck, search for
answers first, then ask on our class :xref:`GitHub Issues` page.

I've selected what I think are good articles and videos for this class.  But
there are many more. You are encouraged to search on your own, and if you
learn a trick we haven't covered, share it.

You will need to spend 10 - 15 hours per week for this class.

Class participation online, between class meetings, is expected.

You are also expected to collaborate, in small teams and as a class.  There
will be team projects -- after all, that is how most of you will work.  I will
comment on your work. You are encouraged to help each other and comment on
each other's work as well.

You should be familiar and comfortable with either a Mac or Windows, and web
browsing.

Class Discussions
******************

Active class participation, both in our weekly meetings and online, is a must.

We will use the :xref:`GitHub Issues` page of this syllabus to discuss questions online. 

GitHub issues function much like a discussion board. You can start a new
issue, and comment on existing issues. Issues are Open or Closed.  I'll close
an issue when the question has been answered. But you can still get good
information by browsing Closed issues.

Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, and comment on others' questions.

To get started, please go to the GitHub - Issues page, find the Introductions
issue, and add a comment to introduce yourself.

Assignments 
***********************

This course is pass/fail. No grades are submitted (unless one is necessary for
tuition reimbursement).

There are short assignments for each technology we cover in class. These
assignments are intended to provide a taste of working with different
technologies.

|Assignment|

I will comment extensively on your work and answer questions.

I also expect you to help your peers.  If you see a question in :xref:`GitHub Issues`, don't wait for me. Try to offer good suggestions.

There is also a :ref:`Project` due at the end of the term. The project will
allow you to work more deeply with a chosen technology.

An Open Source Course
***********************

To align with industry trends, we will use several open source technologies in
this class.  Writers should be aware of these options. The days of buying
expensive software from large vendors, then being locked into that system, are
over.

In addition, we're not just learning about the open source world, we are
experiencing it.

How? Let's look at the ways:

* Much of the content of this course comes from freely available sources, such
  as Wikipedia, YouTube, and SlideShare. My role is to assemble sources into a
  coherent story that meets our objectives.

* Content on |WP| and YouTube, two of our primary sources, is created by
  users, not owners. That is, these platforms derive their value from the
  aggregated efforts of the community, just as do the open source projects we
  will discuss.

* This syllabus is created, stored, and hosted using only open source tools.
  This didn't cost a cent, and just about any aspect of it can be modified.

* In fact, **this syllabus is open source**, with a Creative Commons license.
  You can, and are encouraged to, make it better and to share it, using the
  tools we will learn about.
