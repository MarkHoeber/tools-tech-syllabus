In this lesson we will learn to build an instructional video using Camtasia.


Goals
*********

* Learn our way round the Camtasia editor.

* Capture video of a screen action, and record audio to go with it.

* Use some of the video enhancement tools in Camtasia to provide transitions and callouts.

Assignment

|Assignment| 

#. If using your own computer, :xref:`Download Camtasia` and install it. You can use the trial version for 30 days. (The classroom PCs have Camtasia installed.)

#. Open Camtasia and create a new project.

#. Record a screen action. It can be anything. For example, record yourself doing an easy crossword puzzle or suduko.  It does not have to be something fast. Part of the exercise will be editing the timing of the video to make it go smoothly. So for example, if you struggle with a puzzle, you can edit the video to make it look like you completed it very quickly.

#. Complete the screen recording. It will be saved to the library.

#. Place the video on the timeline. Run the video in the editor to see the results.

#. Now edit the video so it flows nicely. For example, if you did a puzzle, cut the video into clips that match the stages of the puzze. If some parts of the puzzle took a long time, edit that part to speed it up. If you made a mistake in the puzzle, you can cut that part so users don't see it.  Experiment.

#. When the video is to your liking, do a voice recording that explains what you are doing in the video.  Complete the video and add it to your timeline in a separate track.

#. Play the video again, together with the voice recording.

#. Edit the timing of the video and audio clips so they align as intended.

#. If you break the video into parts, add transitions between the clips. Experiment with the transition styles.

#. Use the annotation tools to add callouts to the video clips to show what is referenced in the audio.

#. Iterate over the video to get the time and transitions as smooth as posslbe.

#. Create an MP4 file from your project. 
   
#. Validate all of your files.
