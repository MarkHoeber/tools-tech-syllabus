#. Create a new branch in your fork of the :xref:`Get Started with DITA`.

#. Pull the branch to your computer, then open the files with oXygen.

#. Review the topics you submitted in the :ref:`DITA` lesson. Now think of
   organizing those topics into a document. Add the topic references into a
   new DITA map.

#. Publish and review the PDF and HTML for your map.  Attach the PDF and a zip file of HTML files when you create a pull request.
