Sublime
########################################

.. note:: This section is optional.  You can complete work for this class by editing text directly in GitHub. However Sublime provides many features that make writing and editing more efficient, and I encourage you to explore it on your own.

Sublime lets you edit plain text, and includes many packages that help with
specific languages.

Through there are various tools to make work easier, working in plain text
will give you a better understanding of the subjects we will cover. You can
choose to use other plain text tools, such as Atom, Notepad, or Visual
Studio Code.

Also see :xref:`Sphinx_Sublime_Doc` for more details.
