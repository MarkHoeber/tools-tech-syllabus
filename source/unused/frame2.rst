Assignment
************

|Assignment| 

Create a Frame book.  Use the document from the previous lesson as one chapter, and add at least two more chapters. (The content is not important; you can even duplicate the first file.)

Add:

* A handful of index entries in each file.

* A cross reference in each file to one of the other files.

* A variable

Assemble the documents in the book. Add a cover page, TOC, and index. Then generate the PDF book.
