Assignment
************

|Assignment| 

#. Create a new branch in your fork of the :xref:`Get Started with DITA`.

#. Pull the branch to your computer, then open the files with oXygen.

#. Review the work you submitted in the :ref:`RST` lesson.  Then use that
   content to create new DITA files as needed.  Try to adhere to the topic
   model:  one topic per file, as a concept, task, or reference.

   Don't worry yet about how the files/topics are organized for users. We'll tackle that in the next lesson, :ref:`DITA Maps`.
   
#. Validate all of your files.
