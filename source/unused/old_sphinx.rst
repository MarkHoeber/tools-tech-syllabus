###################################

Sphinx is a tool for compiling sets of RST files into an HTML website. (You
can also use Sphinx to create many other document formats.)

We will use Sphinx to publish the RST content to a website.

Goals
*********

* To understand the role of Sphinx in building documentation.

* To learn how to organize a Sphinx document and reuse content.

* To build a documentation set with Sphinx.

Readings
*********

* :xref:`Sphinx Overview`
* :xref:`First Steps with Sphinx`

Videos
*******

This videos are very long and detailed.  You don't need to go through it
completely for the purposes of this course. But it's a great resources if
you need to complete real projects in Sphinx. You can also increase the
YouTube speed.

Install Sphinx
****************

.. note:: Installing Sphinx is optional. We can do everything needed online through GitHub and ReadTheDocs

To build your HTML document on your computer, you must install Sphinx.

#. If you are using Windows, you might need to :xref:`Python Install`.

   Depending on your Windows setup, after installation you might need to manually add the Python directory to your path. Try the :xref:`Python Windows Install` for help.

   If you are using a Mac, it's probably installed.

#. :xref:`PIP Install`.

   Depending on your Windows setup, after installation you might need to manually add the PIP directory to your path.

#. Use PIP to install Sphinx. On the command line, enter::

   $ pip install Sphinx

.. note:: If you are using Windows, this might be a frustrating task. If you get stuck, share the error messages and ask for help.

Assignment
*************

|Assignment|

Verify Sphinx Setup
====================

#. Make a fork of :xref:`Get Started Sphinx Repo` in your own GitHub account.

#. Read the repository ReadMe.

#. Check out your repository on your computer.

#. Open a command prompt and change directories to the ``get_started_sphinx``
   directory.

#. Run the command ``make html``. Check if there are warnings or errors in
   the command window.

#. Check for the HTML output in the ``get_started_sphinx/build/html`` directory.

#. Open the file ``index.html``.

   The page should look like the following image.

   .. image:: images/get_started_sphinx.png
     :width: 600

Make sure you complete these steps with no warnings or errors before proceeding.

Create your own Sphinx Project
=================================

Look back to the last class on :ref:`RST`. Review your fork of 
:xref:`RST Templates Repository`, and the files your created as part of that assignment.

You can use the content of those files.  Add them into the your fork of the
:xref:`Get Started Sphinx Repo` repository, or copy the content into the files
that are already part of this Sphinx project.

When you have added content to RST files in the Sphinx project:

#. Run the command ``make html``.  Check if there are warnings or errors in
   the command window that you did not get in the first exercise. Fix those
   issues.  Use Google, or :xref:`GitHub Issues` if you get stuck.

#. Check for the HTML output in the ``get_started_sphinx/build/html`` directory.

#. Open the file ``index.html``. Check that the content is what you expect.

#. Iterate over these steps until the document is what you intended.

Extra Credit
***************

* Change the Sphinx theme by changing the value of ``html_theme`` in the
  ``conf.py`` file. Search Sphinx documentation for more information.

* Checkout the :xref:`Tools and Technology Repo` (the source for this
  syllabus). Examine how the document is organized and compare it to the
  syllabus you are viewing. Create a branch and make an improvement in this
  syllabus. Build it locally and ensure it comes out as you expect. Then
  submit a pull request.

Recommended if you intend to do your final project in Sphinx.
