DITA
#############################

In this lesson we will build on our DITA skills.

Goals
*********

* Deepen understanding of DITA.

* Understand DTDs and validation.

* Create HTML and PDF documents from DITA.


Readings
*********

* :xref:`DITA Topics` (Read carefully)

oXygen
*********

For working with DITA, we will use a program called :xref:`oXygen XML Editor`.

Download and install the trial version, which you can use for 30 days.

(You can also use GitHub on the web or Sublime locally to work directly in
DITA code. Note that you can't validate XML files when editing on GitHub.)

Assignment
************

#. Pull the branch of your version of :xref:`Get Started with DITA` to your computer, then 
   open the files with oXygen.

#. Explore the DITA examples packaged with Oxygen:  flowers, garage, and others.

#. In oXygen, create files for a new project of your choice.  Use at least one concept, task, and reference file.  Think carefully about the types of topics and what type of information goes where.
   
#. Validate all of your files.

In the next lesson, we'll assemble files into a map.
