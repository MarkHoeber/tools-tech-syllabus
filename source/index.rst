Tools and Technologies for Technical Writers
#####################################################

**Middlesex Community College**

This course will help you become familiar with a wide variety of current tools
and technologies writers use to create, manage, and publish online content.

Getting Started
******************

To get started, we will set up our content management, GitHub, and dive into the basics of online content: HTML and CSS.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   intro
   projects
   github
   html
   css

**Submit URL to your GitHub repository with the CSS assignment to Blackboard by 2/18/2018.**

Sphinx and RST
******************

Now that we've learned some HTML, it should be apparent that writing large
volumes of content directly in HTML would not be efficient.  There are several
markup languages that we can use to produce HTML more easily.  We'll look in
some detail at a common tool stack: Sphinx and RST.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
    
   sublime
   rst
   sphinx
   rtd

**Submit URL to your GitHub repository with the Sphinx assignment, and the URL to your ReadtheDocs project, to Blackboard by 3/11/2018.**
   
.. note:: I also maintain a separate document, :xref:`Sphinx_Sublime_Doc` that goes into more detail about these technologies than we will cover in class.  It might be useful to those who do a final project with Sphinx. It is a work in progress and contributions are welcome.

XML and DITA
******************

DITA is an XML schema used extensively in technical documentation, especially
at large organizations such as IBM and Oracle. DITA enables **structured
authoring**, which requires writers to adhere to a set of rules.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   xml
   dita-intro
   dita
   dita-maps

**Submit URL to your GitHub repository with the DITA Maps assignment to Blackboard by 4/8/2018.**

Publishing Systems
*******************

There are many more robust publishing systems that we can use to develop
content with more fine-grained control.  These programs offer more features
and capabilities than markup languages, but also involve more complexity and
overhead. We can still produce HTML, as well as some other formats.

Unlike the previously-covered technologies, these tools require a paid
license. For purposes of this course, you can get a 30-day trial license.

Wrap Up
*******************

We will use the last two classes to work on and present our projects.

**Submit your final project (URL or files) to Blackboard by 5/11/2018.**
