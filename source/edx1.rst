In this lesson we will start building an online course.

Goals
*********

* Get familiar with constructing an online course.

* Learn how to use Open edX Studio to create course content.

* Understand how to use the Studio outline to build a course.


Readings
*********

* :xref:`Open edX`
* :xref:`Build a Course Documentation`
* :xref:`How to Build a Course`

Class Open edX Website
*************************

The course website is :xref:`Course Website`. This is referred to as the LMS, for "Learning Management System."


To get started, you must first register at :xref:`Open edX Register`. You can then log into that site, see and enroll in courses created by the class.


Open edX Studio
****************

To build the courses you see in the LMS, you use Open edX Studio.  

Log in to :xref:`Studio` using the same credentials you registered on the LMS with.

You will see listed the course for which you have author rights, which has been set up for you.  The work for this an the next lessons will be in this course.  Open it to begin.


Assignment
************

In this assignment, we will get started with building course content. In the documentation listed above, read the section **Developing Your Course** carefully. Then think about how you would structure content you have been working with in a course form.

#. Open the course in Studio. The course outline should open by default. To ever return to this page, select **Content --> Outline** from th menu.

#. Start by exploring the sections, subsections, and units. Open up individual units, and try editing or adding units.  We will demo this in class.

#. Explore the problems in the units.  Make not of the syntax.  We will cover problems and grading in more depth in later lessons.

#. Go back to the outline. Not how you can drag and drop all objects on the outline to different locations.

#. Publish your changes (see the documentation).

#. Look in the course in the LMS to see if your changes are presented as you expected.
